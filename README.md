# Currency-Converter

Utilize python language to create a real time currency converter with the use of tkinter and request.
Reads an API key from a website that allows my code to convert currency at a real time rate. 

IMPORTANT
The only problem with the code is the API key in the website needs to be resetted due to a limited use 
You can add/change the API that the code is using by getting your own key and changing it from the Main.py file and change the URL link in the Converter.py file
